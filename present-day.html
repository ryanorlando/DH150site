Jon Jarvis, Former Director of the National Park Service</strong></p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest assets of the National Park System is that its large geographic footprint and lack of exclusionary policies give it the potential to host an incredibly diverse range of visitors. In its ideal state, the National Park System provides a sanctuary and opportunity to appreciate nature for citizens and international visitors of all races and ethnicities. Unfortunately, in its history, the National Park System has largely failed to do that. In official and unofficial surveys, it has consistently been found that National Parks visitors are overwhelmingly and disproportionately white. This is likely due to a number of factors, including wealth disparity, transportation access, and geographic disparities in demographics. </span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/9/Screen-Shot-2021-12-03-at-6.04.23-PM.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/9/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-12-03-at-6.04.23-PM-xs.png 300w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/9/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-12-03-at-6.04.23-PM-sm.png 480w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/9/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-12-03-at-6.04.23-PM-md.png 768w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/9/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-12-03-at-6.04.23-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/9/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-12-03-at-6.04.23-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/9/responsive/Screen-Shot-2021-12-03-at-6.04.23-PM-2xl.png 1600w" alt="National Park Service Visitation Demographics" width="783" height="579"></figure><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Park Service has made it a priority to address this concern in their policies and practices. In 2011, then-director of the NPS Jon Jarvis introduced his “<a href="https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2011/08/national-park-service-issues-5-year-call-action-plan-moving-toward-its-second-century8687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call to Action</a>” plan, aimed to narrow the gap between population demographics and actual visitation numbers. While these numbers still remain skewed, the NPS has shown a clear and concentrated effort to improve their relationship with minority communities. In particular, the department is working to change their internal culture, expand outreach and education, and improve affordability. Read more about these efforts <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/diversity-accessibility-representation-inclusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (free sign-up required). </span><p></p><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of these efforts, an important step was taken recently to honor the history of the National Parks and those that originally inhabited them. When Charles Sams was confirmed as President Biden’s appointee as director of the National Park Service, he became the first Director of Native American descent in the history of the department. This was a <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2021/10/oregons-chuck-sams-umatilla-tribal-leader-on-historic-quest-to-lead-105-year-old-park-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrated step</a> for the administration, and Director Sams has spearheaded efforts to preserve and share the rich cultural histories of our parks. </span></p><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, there is still much work to be done for our National Park System to represent our nation’s diversity and honor the history of the lands we now preserve, but the actions of the National Park Service over the past two decades have inspired hope that this is an attainable goal in future generations. As a largely apolitical department in the federal government, the NPS has the freedom to operate with its own goals in mind and continue to improve upon one of our nation’s greatest achievements.</span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uH0Czidpn28" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
