While these groups worked together to explore the area further and set up functioning communities, contact with White settlers also brought difficulty to the lives of the Paiutes. Naturally, disease and violence wreaked havoc on the local population, and within a few decades, the Paiute population had plummeted. The modern day Paiute tribe says this decline took them from thousands of members in the tribe to under 800. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Zion area and the surrounding cities were developed over the coming years, the region was swarmed by an influx of visitors, ranging from permanent settlers to adventure-seeking explorers. Mormon settlers continued to protect the area, recognizing the unique beauty that the canyon held. One well-known explorer, John Wesley Powell, gave the region an alternate name, calling it Mukuntuweap, a Paiute word that means “straight canyon”. In 1909, President William Taft declared the area to be federally protected under this Paiute name, and Mukuntuweap National Monument was born. However, in 1918, the assistant director of the National Parks Service, Horace Albright, took it upon himself to change the name to Zion National Monument, and a year later, it was designated as a national park under the same name. </span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/6/SNAP_20200703-130247-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/6/responsive/SNAP_20200703-130247-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/6/responsive/SNAP_20200703-130247-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/6/responsive/SNAP_20200703-130247-2-md.jpg 768w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/6/responsive/SNAP_20200703-130247-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/6/responsive/SNAP_20200703-130247-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/6/responsive/SNAP_20200703-130247-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="A Preserved Mormon Settlement" width="1792" height="903"><figcaption>An Early Mormon Settlement</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of the Paiute people is often overlooked and erased, with park's the sudden name change serving as the perfect evidence of this trend. Today, the Paiute tribes are still recovering from the near extinction of their people. The Paiutes are now a nation of five tribes in Southern Utah, and they continue to fight for a place to live in their native land, not the reservation they were assigned to in the 1950s.
