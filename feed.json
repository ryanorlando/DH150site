            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The topography and harsh desert climate of the Joshua Tree region gives it a distinctive history of human interaction. The intense swings between heat and cold in days and nights made early living in this area very difficult, and the lack of natural cover in the terrain meant that there were few viable locations for groups to settle in. Still, small groups of Native Americans made the most of the area. The Pinto tribes were the first to inhabit the Joshua Tree area, over 5,000 years ago. Civilizations in this area remained small and volatile, as it was difficult to maintain significant population numbers in such a harsh climate. One location, the Oasis of Mara, stands out as a primary representation of this trend. Originally inhabited by the Serrano people, it was also home to communities such as the Chemehuevi and the Cahuilla. The Oasis of Mara provided a water source and some cover for small communities to exist, and this is one of only a few well-documented long-term establishments. </span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the early part of the 20th century, most native populations had vanished from the Joshua Tree area. This was largely due to a massive influx of land developers and cactus poachers paving roads through the area. Where these populations migrated to is a mystery, but they likely moved further into the desert to escape the threat of forced relocation. In 1936, Joshua Tree was set aside as a national monument, halting all development inside the laid out borders and protecting the natural land. It was not until 1994 that Joshua Tree was designated as a National Park. </span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Joshua Tree preserves and protects the former native lands, but much of the history of this area has been erased by time. Unlike many other parks, Native Americans did not leave much evidence of civilizations behind, outside of some tools, pots, and rock art. These remnants are now protected by the park, but the park is now largely focused on preserving the natural land and the unique species that reside there.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For over 5,500 years, the people of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation have called Yosemite Valley home. While harsh weather and environments are not uncommon in Yosemite Valley, the area served as a sanctuary for these tribes, and they were closely tied with these lands. The rugged terrain and sheltered settlements served to protect the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation from incursions by Spanish, American, and Mexican colonists, and for centuries they were able to live peacefully under the beautiful landscape that they honored. However, the California Gold Rush in 1849 changed all of that. Outside settlers finally reached Yosemite Valley, and they wasted no time in conquering and relocating the local tribes. Within a few years, the Southern Sierra Miwuk people, as well as all the other small local tribes, were all but pushed out of their ancestral lands. Today, small pockets of Southern Sierra Miwuk people still remain in Mariposa County, where they work closely with the park to ensure that their lands are still honored and their history is still taught to visitors. </span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many names and traditions in Yosemite National Park are drawn from Southern Sierra Miwok culture, including the name Yosemite itself. Several prominent locations in the park also have traditional names, and the park also presents many aspects of Southern Sierra Miwok culture, through presentations, museums, and preserved sites. Despite the best efforts of Yosemite National Park’s organizers, the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation is still petitioning the US government for federal recognition as a protected tribe, a fight that has endured since 1982.

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long before Mormon settlers and missionaries reached Southern Utah and the Zion Canyon, the area was inhabited by the Paiute tribe of Native Americans. While these groups worked together to explore the area further and set up functioning communities, contact with White settlers brought difficulty to the lives of the Paiutes. Naturally, disease and violence wreaked havoc on the local population, and within a few decades, the Paiute population had plummeted. The modern day Paiute tribe says this decline took them from thousands of members of the tribe to under 800. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Zion area and the surrounding cities were developed over the coming years, the region was swarmed by an influx of visitors, ranging from permanent settlers to adventure-seeking explorers. Mormon settlers continued to protect the area, recognizing the unique beauty that the canyon held. One well-known explorer, John Wesley Powell, gave the region an alternate name, calling it Mukuntuweap, a Paiute word that means “straight canyon”. In 1909, President William Taft declared the area to be federally protected, under this Paiute name, and Mukuntuweap National Monument was born. However, in 1918, the assistant director of the National Parks Service, Horace Albright, took it upon himself to change the name to Zion National Monument, and a year later, it was designated as a national park under the same name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The history of the Paiute people is often overlooked and erased, with the sudden name change serving as the perfect evidence of this trend. Today, the Paiute tribes are still recovering from the near extinction of their people. The Paiutes are now a nation of five tribes in Southern Utah, and they continue to fight for a place to live in their native land, not the reservation they were assigned to in the 1950s.

The national parks are often held on stolen land, taken from indigenous peoples who were never fairly compensated, in a situation where no compensation could ever validate the theft of a home. National parks are also disproportionately enjoyed by white Americans, and undervisited among communities of color. Lost in the beauty of these parks and the overall positivity of this system are these issues and many others.</p>\n<p>This website aims to tell two stories: the history of the National Parks system and the story of the opposite perspective, for which the benefit of the parks is not felt in nearly the same way. As the author, I have chosen to focus on a select few parks on the west coast that I have visited (<a href=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/zion-national-park.html\">Zion</a>, <a href=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/yosemite-national-park.html\">Yosemite</a>, and <a href=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/joshua-tree-national-park.html\">Joshua Tree</a>), and each page will attempt to tell both stories, along with images that I have captured there. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/1/gallery/IMG_6629.jpeg\" data-size=\"4032x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/1/gallery/IMG_6629-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"Yosemite National Park, California\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>Yosemite National Park, California</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/1/gallery/IMG_6697.jpeg\" data-size=\"4032x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/1/gallery/IMG_6697-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"Angel's Landing\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>Zion National Park, Utah</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/1/gallery/IMG_5974.jpeg\" data-size=\"4032x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/media/posts/1/gallery/IMG_5974-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"Joshua Tree National Park, California\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>Joshua Tree National Park, California</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
