The National Parks system represents some of the best parts of our country, preserving our natural beauty for everyone to enjoy. </p>\n<p>However, this system is not perfect. The national parks are often held on stolen land, taken from indigenous peoples who were never fairly compensated, in a situation where no compensation could ever validate the theft of a home. National parks are also disproportionately enjoyed by white Americans, and undervisited among communities of color. Lost in the beauty of these parks and the overall positivity of this system are these issues and many others.</p>\n<p>This website aims to tell two stories: the history of the National Parks system and the story of the opposite perspective, in which the benefit of the parks in not felt in nearly the same way.
