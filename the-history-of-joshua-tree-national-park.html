The intense swings between heat and cold in days and nights made early living in this area very difficult, and the lack of natural cover in the terrain meant that there were few viable locations for groups to settle in. Still, small groups of Native Americans made the most of the area. The Pinto tribes were the first to inhabit the Joshua Tree area, over 5,000 years ago. Civilizations in this area remained small and volatile, as it was difficult to maintain significant population numbers in such a harsh climate. One location, the Oasis of Mara, stands out as a primary representation of this trend. Originally inhabited by the Serrano people, it was also home to communities such as the Chemehuevi and the Cahuilla. The Oasis of Mara provided a water source and some cover for small communities to exist, and this is one of only a few well-documented long-term establishments. </span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/RWf7xU_brAl7xG5qntzVz8WwjN78fvZMaobl_0Eyij9XPa98pTUTojSBhfqn3f24MnWDX4h4A57vYAGE4-LQC2mArvnrz4yCx6uZvxO_XDaeT6BqCYu6tJJC3Asmg5sHLQNREFetbvsipmhK4-BM178Q6MIhYld_dueR4SpVPz37" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Petroglyphs like these are some of the only remaining signs of Native American life in Joshua Tree" width="512" height="341"><figcaption>Petroglyphs like these are some of the only remaining signs of Native American life in Joshua Tree</figcaption></figure><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the early part of the 20th century, most native populations had vanished from the Joshua Tree area. This was largely due to a massive influx of land developers and cactus poachers paving roads through the area. Where these populations migrated to is a mystery, but they likely moved further into the desert to escape the threat of forced relocation. In 1936, Joshua Tree was set aside as a national monument, halting all development inside the laid out borders and protecting the natural land. It was not until 1994 that Joshua Tree was designated as a National Park. </span></p><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Joshua Tree preserves and protects the former native lands, but much of the history of this area has been erased by time. Unlike in many other parks, Native Americans did not leave much evidence of civilizations behind, outside of some tools, pots, and rock art. These remnants are now protected by the park, but the park is now largely focused on preserving the natural land and the unique species that reside there.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
