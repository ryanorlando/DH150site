While harsh weather and natural environments are not uncommon in Yosemite Valley, the area served as a sanctuary for these tribes, and they were closely tied to their lands. The rugged terrain and sheltered settlements served to protect the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation from incursions by Spanish, American, and Mexican colonists, and for centuries they were able to live peacefully under the beautiful landscape that they honored. However, the California Gold Rush in 1849 changed all of that. Outside settlers finally reached Yosemite Valley, and they wasted no time in conquering and relocating the local tribes. Within a few years, the Southern Sierra Miwuk people, as well as all the other small local tribes, were all but pushed out of their ancestral lands. Today, small pockets of Southern Sierra Miwuk people still remain in Mariposa County, where they work closely with the park to ensure that their lands are still honored and their history is still taught to visitors. </span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yosemite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/miwuk-legacy-2-1024x600-1.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="A Southern Sierra Miwuk Woman" width="1024" height="600"><figcaption>A Southern Sierra Miwuk Woman</figcaption></figure><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many names and traditions in Yosemite National Park are drawn from Southern Sierra Miwok culture, including the Yosemite name itself. Several prominent locations in the park also have traditional names, and the park also presents many aspects of Southern Sierra Miwok culture, through presentations, museums, and preserved sites. Despite the best efforts of Yosemite National Park’s organizers, the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation is still petitioning the US government for federal recognition as a protected tribe, a fight that has endured since 1982.
