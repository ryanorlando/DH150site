<p class="align-center"><strong>"We know that visitation does not reflect the diversity of the nation, and that’s a concern" - Jon Jarvis, Former Director of the National Park Service</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest advantages of the National Park System is its large geographic footprint and lack of exclusionary policies, which give it the potential to host an incredibly diverse range of visitors. In its ideal state, the National Park System provides a sanctuary and opportunity to appreciate nature for citizens and international visitors of all races and ethnicities. Unfortunately, in its history, the National Park System has largely failed to do that. In official and unofficial surveys, it has consistently been found that National Parks visitors are overwhelmingly and disproportionately white. This is likely due to a number of factors, including wealth disparity, transportation access, and geographic disparities in demographics. </span></p>

In 2011, then-director of the NPS Jon Jarvis introduced his “<a href="https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2011/08/national-park-service-issues-5-year-call-action-plan-moving-toward-its-second-century8687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call to Action</a>” plan, aimed to narrow the gap between population demographics and actual visitation numbers. While these numbers still remain skewed, the NPS has shown a clear and concentrated effort to improve their relationship with minority communities. In particular, the department is working to change their internal culture, expand outreach and education, and improve affordability. Read more about these efforts in a great article from National Geographic <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/diversity-accessibility-representation-inclusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (free sign-up required). </span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of these efforts, an important step was taken recently to honor the history of the National Parks and those that originally inhabited them. When Charles Sams was confirmed as President Biden’s appointee as director of the National Park Service, he became the first Director of Native American descent in the history of the department. This was a <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2021/10/oregons-chuck-sams-umatilla-tribal-leader-on-historic-quest-to-lead-105-year-old-park-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrated step</a> for the administration, and Director Sams has spearheaded efforts to preserve and share the rich cultural histories of our parks. </span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, there is still much work to be done for our National Park System to represent our nation’s diversity and honor the history of the lands we now preserve, but the actions of the National Park Service over the past two decades have inspired hope that this is an attainable goal in future generations. As a largely apolitical department in the federal government, the NPS has the freedom to operate with its own goals in mind and continue to improve upon one of our nation’s greatest achievements.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topography and harsh desert climate of the Joshua Tree region gives it a distinctive history of human interaction. The intense swings between heat and cold in days and nights made early living in this area very difficult, and the lack of natural cover in the terrain meant that there were few viable locations for groups to settle in. Still, small groups of Native Americans made the most of the area. The Pinto tribes were the first to inhabit the Joshua Tree area, over 5,000 years ago. Civilizations in this area remained small and volatile, as it was difficult to maintain significant population numbers in such a harsh climate. One location, the Oasis of Mara, stands out as a primary representation of this trend. Originally inhabited by the Serrano people, it was also home to communities such as the Chemehuevi and the Cahuilla. The Oasis of Mara provided a water source and some cover for small communities to exist, and this is one of only a few well-documented long-term establishments. </span></p>

<figcaption >Petroglyphs like these are some of the only remaining signs of Native American life in Joshua Tree</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the early part of the 20th century, most native populations had vanished from the Joshua Tree area. This was largely due to a massive influx of land developers and cactus poachers paving roads through the area. Where these populations migrated to is a mystery, but they likely moved further into the desert to escape the threat of forced relocation. In 1936, Joshua Tree was set aside as a national monument, halting all development inside the laid out borders and protecting the natural land. It was not until 1994 that Joshua Tree was designated as a National Park. </span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Joshua Tree preserves and protects the former native lands, but much of the history of this area has been erased by time. Unlike in many other parks, Native Americans did not leave much evidence of civilizations behind, outside of some tools, pots, and rock art. These remnants are now protected by the park, but the park is largely focused on preserving the natural land and the unique species that reside there.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over 5,500 years, the people of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation have called Yosemite Valley home. While harsh weather and natural environments are not uncommon in Yosemite Valley, the area served as a sanctuary for these tribes, and they were closely tied to their lands. The rugged terrain and sheltered settlements served to protect the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation from incursions by Spanish, American, and Mexican colonists, and for centuries they were able to live peacefully under the beautiful landscape that they honored. However, the California Gold Rush in 1849 changed all of that. Outside settlers finally reached Yosemite Valley, and they wasted no time in conquering and relocating the local tribes. Within a few years, the Southern Sierra Miwuk people, as well as all the other small local tribes, were all but pushed out of their ancestral lands. Today, small pockets of Southern Sierra Miwuk people still remain in Mariposa County, where they work closely with the park to ensure that their lands are still honored and their history is still taught to visitors. </span></p>

<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many names and traditions in Yosemite National Park are drawn from Southern Sierra Miwok culture, including the Yosemite name itself. Several prominent locations in the park also have traditional names, and the park also presents many aspects of Southern Sierra Miwok culture, through presentations, museums, and preserved sites. Despite the best efforts of Yosemite National Park’s organizers, the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation is still petitioning the US government for federal recognition as a protected tribe, a fight that has endured since 1982.

            <![CDATA[
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before Mormon settlers and missionaries reached Southern Utah and the Zion Canyon, the area was inhabited by the Paiute tribe of Native Americans. While these groups worked together to explore the area further and set up functioning communities, contact with White settlers also brought difficulty to the lives of the Paiutes. Naturally, disease and violence wreaked havoc on the local population, and within a few decades, the Paiute population had plummeted. The modern day Paiute tribe says this decline took them from thousands of members in the tribe to under 800. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Zion area and the surrounding cities were developed over the coming years, the region was swarmed by an influx of visitors, ranging from permanent settlers to adventure-seeking explorers. Mormon settlers continued to protect the area, recognizing the unique beauty that the canyon held. One well-known explorer, John Wesley Powell, gave the region an alternate name, calling it Mukuntuweap, a Paiute word that means “straight canyon”. In 1909, President William Taft declared the area to be federally protected under this Paiute name, and Mukuntuweap National Monument was born. However, in 1918, the assistant director of the National Parks Service, Horace Albright, took it upon himself to change the name to Zion National Monument, and a year later, it was designated as a national park under the same name. </span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of the Paiute people is often overlooked and erased, with park's the sudden name change serving as the perfect evidence of this trend. Today, the Paiute tribes are still recovering from the near extinction of their people. The Paiutes are now a nation of five tribes in Southern Utah, and they continue to fight for a place to live in their native land, not the reservation they were assigned to in the 1950s.

                <p>Hidden out in the desert near Palm Springs, Joshua Tree is an experience unlike many others. Defined by its rocky structures and namesake trees, this park presents the unusual geography of a desert that sits at high elevation. With very few mapped hikes and landmarks, this park is perfect for those who prefer exploring on their own. More confident visitors can climb up huge rock formations, eager explorers can set out to forger thei own path, or young families can observe the unique wildlife all around. This park completely changes in the darkness when the desert comes to life, making it a popular camping destination. While less is known about early activity in this park, it is still clear that it is a land that holds a significant <a href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/the-history-of-joshua-tree-national-park.html">history</a>.</p>

                <p>Set back in central California far to the east of San Francisco, Yosemite National Park is a favorite destination for adventurers of all kinds. With massive granite peaks and tree-filled valleys, this park offers fun of all varieties. Daring rock clibers can grapple up the side of the famous El Capitan, while families relax and picnic in the valley below. Flowing waterfalls serve to accent the majesty of this park, especially in the winter and spring. With a rich <a href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/the-history-of-yosemite-national-park.html">history</a> and a present day reputation as a must-see park, Yosemite is one of the most well-known destinations in the National Park System.</p>

                <p>Located in Southern Utah, about 3 hours from Las Vegas, the majestic Zion Canyon is one of the most popular national parks in the country. With soaring rock formations and awe-inspiring views, this park is particularly radiant at sunrise and sunset. Zion offers a diverse range of adventure options, from wading through rushing water in the Narrows to taking in the full expanse of the canyon from the top of the death-defying Angel's Landing summit. It also has a facinating <a href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/the-history-of-zion-national-park.html">history</a>, which only serves to highlight the importance of understanding this park even further.</p>

<p class="align-center"><i>“There is nothing so American as our national parks…. The fundamental idea behind the parks…is that the country belongs to the people, that it is in process of making for the enrichment of the lives of all of us.” - President Franklin D. Roosevelt</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1872, Congress created the first national park: Yellowstone National Park. 44 years later, on on August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson established the National Park Service. These two events launched one of the most ambitious and beneficial projects in our nation's history. The National Park System represents some of the best parts of our country, preserving our natural beauty for everyone to enjoy. </p>
<p>However, this system is not perfect. The national parks are often held on stolen land, taken from indigenous peoples who were never fairly compensated, in a situation where no compensation could ever validate the theft of a home. National parks are also disproportionately enjoyed by white Americans, and undervisited among communities of color. Lost in the beauty of these parks and the overall positivity of this system are these issues and many others.</p>
<p>This website aims to tell two stories: the history of the National Parks system and the story of the opposite perspective, for which the benefit of the parks is not felt in nearly the same way. As the author, I have chosen to focus on a select few parks on the west coast that I have visited (<a href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/zion-national-park.html">Zion</a>, <a href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/yosemite-national-park.html">Yosemite</a>, and <a href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/joshua-tree-national-park.html">Joshua Tree</a>), and each page will attempt to tell both stories, along with images that I have captured there. To find the information that inspired this project, as well as resources for further research, visit the <a href="https://ryanorlando.github.io/DH150site/resources-and-further-reading.html">Resources</a> page. </p>
